"""Black-hole accretion: simulations and "black hole weather" forecasting with a trust horizon.

Submodules: ``runs`` (generate / resume / read simulation runs), ``convergence`` (resolution study: conservative
remap, observed order and GCI, statistical convergence), ``dataset`` (the zoo dataset of whole trajectories),
``forecast`` (the U-Net, training with rollout loss / noise / mass penalty, rollouts, trust horizon, mass envelope),
``skill`` (skill against persistence, climatology and DMD with bootstrap intervals, physics checks), ``twin``,
``raytrace``, ``capture``.
