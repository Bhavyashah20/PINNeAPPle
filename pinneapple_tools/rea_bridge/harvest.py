"""Harvest ledger: what was studied, under which license, and what came of it.

Each :class:`HarvestEntry` records one studied project (URL, commit, license
policy, the REA Evidence id/SHA-256 when REA was used) and its
:class:`Finding` items -- an idea, a technique or a feature, where it lives in
the original, and what PINNeAPPle did with it.

``Finding.status`` values:

``idea``           noted, nothing implemented yet
``adapted``        PINNeAPPle code derived from the original code (needs ``adapt``)
``reimplemented``  written from the published method / observed behaviour
``exists``         PINNeAPPle already had it; the finding only cross-checks
``rejected``       studied and not taken (``note`` says why)

The ledger enforces the license gate: an ``adapted`` finding under a
``clean_room`` or ``reference_only`` policy is refused at construction time,
so the rule cannot be bypassed by editing a JSON file and reloading it.
